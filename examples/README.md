# Examples

This folder is a collection of various examples on how to do things with the plugin. 

If you would like to add an example:
- Add a `README.md` file that explains your example. A paragraph or two.  
- Note which files to look at. 
- Any other information that you think will be useful to other developers

If you get lost then you can look at the README for `manual-installation`

Happy browsing :-)
